<p>I&rsquo;m Dmitrii Novikov, a distributed systems engineer based in Montenegro.</p>
<p>I spend my days building and operating cloud-native data platforms. I maintain 20+ microservices on the OSDU platform — a large-scale data infrastructure serving the energy industry, running on Google Cloud and Kubernetes. I&rsquo;ve been doing backend engineering for over 6 years, primarily in Java/Spring Boot.</p>
<p>I care most about the intersection of distributed systems and observability — making complex multi-service architectures transparent enough that you can actually understand what&rsquo;s happening inside them.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I build things in Go.
I write here about distributed systems, Go, observability patterns, and lessons from operating microservices in production.
