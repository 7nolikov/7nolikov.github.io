JSON API is a specification that standardizes how clients and servers exchange data using JSON. It defines a consistent structure for API responses, helping reduce redundant requests and making APIs easier to develop and maintain.

## Key Features

- Consistent Format: All responses follow the same structure.
- Efficient Data Loading: Fetch related resources in one request.
- Sparse Fieldsets: Request only the fields you need.
- Built-in Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting: Makes handling large datasets simpler.
