The article on PlanetScale's blog explains how B-Trees, a data structure, are used in database indexes to make data retrieval faster and more efficient. Indexes act like a "table of contents" for databases, helping you quickly find the data you need without scanning the entire dataset.

## Key Points

- What Are B-Trees?
  B-Trees are a tree-like structure that organizes data in sorted order. They allow databases to quickly search, insert, and delete data by reducing the number of comparisons needed.

- Why Use B-Trees for Indexes?
  B-Trees are perfect for databases because:

  - They keep data balanced, ensuring fast access even with large datasets.
  - They reduce the number of disk reads, which speeds up queries.
  - They work well for range queries (e.g., finding all records between two values).

- How It Helps Databases
  When you create an index on a database column, it uses B-Trees to store the data. This makes operations like searching for specific rows or sorting results significantly faster.

## Practical Example

If youâ€™re searching for all users with IDs between 100 and 200 in a table, an index using B-Trees will quickly find those rows instead of scanning the entire table.

## Why It Matters

Understanding B-Trees and indexes helps developers design faster, more efficient databases. Proper indexing can drastically improve performance for queries, especially on large datasets.
