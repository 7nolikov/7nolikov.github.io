This is a compact metal wallet.
Use it for two years. Very handy. Keys are not rattling around. It can store several cards, cash, and air tag. I like this form factor.

Alternatives include Ridge Wallet, Ekster, Secrid, and Vaultskin wallets, which also offer slim designs and strong materials.

You definitely need to try one of these wallets:
