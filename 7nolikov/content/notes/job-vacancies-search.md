You can use advanced Google search queries to find job vacancies on LinkedIn that match specific roles and include details about visa sponsorship or relocation support. Here’s how the provided links work:

## 1. Broad Search Query

The first link is a general Google search query that looks for jobs with titles like

- **Java Developer**
- **Java Engineer**
- **Software Engineer**
- **Backend Developer**
- **Software Developer**

while also including keywords such as

- **Visa Sponsorship**
- **Visa Support**
- **Work Visa**
- **Work Permit**
- **Sponsorship**
- **Relocation**

This query is not limited to LinkedIn but will include relevant results from across the web.

```plaintext
("Java Developer" OR "Java Engineer" OR "Software Engineer" OR "Backend Developer" OR "Software Developer") AND ("Visa Sponsorship" OR "Visa Support" OR "Work Visa" OR "Work Permit" OR "Sponsorship" OR "Relocation")
```

## 2. LinkedIn-Specific Search Query

The second link refines the search to only show results from LinkedIn job pages. It specifically targets job listings on LinkedIn that match the same roles and visa-related keywords. This is done using the **site:linkedin.com/jobs/view/** filter, which limits results to LinkedIn’s job pages.

```plaintext
site:linkedin.com/jobs/view/ ("Java Developer" OR "Java Engineer" OR "Software Engineer" OR "Backend Developer" OR "Software Developer") AND ("Visa Sponsorship" OR "Visa Support" OR "Work Visa" OR "Work Permit" OR "Sponsorship" OR "Relocation")
```

## How to Use These Queries

- Open the provided links in a browser.
- Browse the results to find job listings that meet your criteria.
- Use filters or keywords in the LinkedIn search bar for more tailored results if needed.
- Consider modifying the query to add additional role names or location-specific details (e.g., "in Germany" or "remote").

This approach is highly efficient for finding international job opportunities that offer visa sponsorship or relocation support. It helps bypass LinkedIn's internal search limitations and provides a wider range of results through Google's indexing.
