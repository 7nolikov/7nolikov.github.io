Microsoft has created a tool called **MarkItDown** that converts Office files like **.docx**, **.xlsx**, **.pptx**, and even **PDF** files into Markdown format. Markdown is a simple, lightweight way to format text for websites or documentation, making it ideal for developers and writers.

## Key Features

- Supports many formats: You can convert Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and PDFs.
- Open-source: The tool is available on GitHub, allowing developers to customize or contribute to it.
- Device-friendly: Someone has even made a web app version that runs directly on your device, so you can convert files without installing anything.

## Similar Update from Google

A few months ago, Google added the ability to export Google Docs in Markdown format, making it easier to integrate with content management systems or code repositories.

## Why Itâ€™s Useful

If you often work with Office or Google Docs and need to publish content online or in repositories, these Markdown tools can save time and streamline the process. Also, Markdown files are stored in Obsidian, popular among developers and writers for its flexibility and ease of use.
