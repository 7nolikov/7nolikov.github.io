## Economic actors

**Financial Institutions** are entities like banks, insurance companies, and investment firms that manage money through lending, saving, and investing. For example, JPMorgan Chase and Allianz are key players facilitating loans and managing funds globally.

**Governments** collect money through taxes and public borrowing to fund public services like schools, healthcare, and defense. The U.S. federal government, for instance, uses its budget to maintain infrastructure and social programs.

**Non-Financial Corporations** are businesses that produce goods or provide services, such as Apple in technology or Toyota in manufacturing. They use money to run operations, invest, and generate profits.

**Households** consist of individuals and families managing income for daily expenses, savings, or investments. For example, a family saving for education or buying a home reflects household economic activity.

## Global Money in 2023

The total global money supply (M3, which includes cash, deposits, and other liquid assets) in 2023 is estimated at $160 trillion. This figure includes money held by governments, businesses, and individuals. Here's a breakdown of how this money is distributed globally:

| Category | Estimated Amount (Trillions $) | Share of Total (%) |
|----------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Financial Institutions | 70 | 44% |
| Governments | 25 | 16% |
| Non-Financial Corporations | 40 | 25% |
| Households | 25 | 15% |

## Physical vs Legal Entities

Money can also be classified by ownership, distinguishing between individuals (physical persons) and businesses or governments (legal entities). Globally, individuals hold about 45% of the total money, while legal entities own the rest.

| Ownership | Global Amount (Trillions $) | Share of Total (%) |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Individuals (Households) | 72 | 45% |
| Businesses (Legal Entities) | 64 | 40% |
| Governments | 24 | 15% |

## Money Across 11 Economic Sectors

To further understand the distribution of global money, it is useful to analyze it across the 11 primary economic sectors defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). In 2023, the estimated global money supply is distributed across these sectors as follows:

### World Money by Sector

| Sector | Estimated Amount (Trillions $) | Share of Total (%) |
|--------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Financials | 50 | 31% |
| Technology | 20 | 12% |
| Healthcare | 18 | 11% |
| Energy | 15 | 9% |
| Consumer Staples | 12 | 8% |
| Consumer Discretionary | 14 | 9% |
| Industrials | 13 | 8% |
| Utilities | 5 | 3% |
| Materials | 6 | 4% |
| Real Estate | 7 | 4% |
| Communication Services | 10 | 6% |

In U.S. financial sector alone, the estimated money supply is around $8 trillion, which is about 37% of the total money held by financial institutions.

## Conclusion

Money in the world is not equally distributed, with financial institutions and big corporations holding the largest shares. The United States remains a central hub for global finances. Understanding these dynamics helps individuals make informed decisions about wealth and investments.
