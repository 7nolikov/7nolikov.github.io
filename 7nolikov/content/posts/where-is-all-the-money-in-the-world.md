## Overview of the global money supply

Money is the lifeblood of the global economy, flowing through various sectors, industries, and institutions. Understanding where money is located provides valuable insights into the structure of the global economy, wealth distribution, and financial trends. In 2023, the global money supply is spread across financial institutions, governments, businesses, and households, reflecting diverse economic activities.

## Economic actors

**Financial Institutions** are entities like banks, insurance companies, and investment firms that manage money through lending, saving, and investing. For example, JPMorgan Chase and Allianz are key players facilitating loans and managing funds globally.

**Governments** collect money through taxes and public borrowing to fund public services like schools, healthcare, and defense. The U.S. federal government, for instance, uses its budget to maintain infrastructure and social programs.

**Non-Financial Corporations** are businesses that produce goods or provide services, such as Apple in technology or Toyota in manufacturing. They use money to run operations, invest, and generate profits.

**Households** consist of individuals and families managing income for daily expenses, savings, or investments. For example, a family saving for education or buying a home reflects household economic activity.

## Global Money in 2023

The total global money supply (M3, which includes cash, deposits, and other liquid assets) in 2023 is estimated at **$160 trillion**. This figure includes money held by governments, businesses, and individuals. Here's a breakdown of how this money is distributed globally:

| Category | Estimated Amount (Trillions $) | Share of Total (%) |
|----------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Financial Institutions | 70 | 44% |
| Governments | 25 | 16% |
| Non-Financial Corporations | 40 | 25% |
| Households | 25 | 15% |

## Money in the U.S. Economy

The United States, as the world's largest economy, has a significant portion of global money. In 2023, the U.S. money supply (M2) is around **$21.5 trillion**. The distribution reflects the country's advanced financial system and robust consumer market:
