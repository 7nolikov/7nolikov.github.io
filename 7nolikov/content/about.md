{{< figure src="images/about.jpg" alt="About" >}}

I'm Dmitrii Novikov, a distributed systems engineer based in Montenegro.

I spend my days building and operating cloud-native data platforms. I maintain 20+ microservices on the OSDU platform — a large-scale data infrastructure serving the energy industry, running on Google Cloud and Kubernetes. I've been doing backend engineering for over 6 years, primarily in Java/Spring Boot.

I care most about the intersection of distributed systems and observability — making complex multi-service architectures transparent enough that you can actually understand what's happening inside them.

Outside of work, I build things in Go.
I write here about distributed systems, Go, observability patterns, and lessons from operating microservices in production.
