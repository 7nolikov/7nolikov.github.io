{{< figure src="images/about.jpg" alt="About" >}}

I'm Dmitrii, currently based in Herceg Novi, Montenegro.

Professionally, I work as a Software Engineer at
EPAM. My main focus is on cloud-native technologies, distributed systems, and building scalable and reliable software.

Outside of work, I like to play around with new technologies, learn new things, and play games.

This website is a place for me to share my thoughts, knowledge, and other things I find interesting.
